## Project Description

`golang-toko` is a command-line application built with Go that helps manage a small shop or store. It allows users to easily track inventory, manage products, and record transactions. The application is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and suitable for small businesses or individuals who need a simple inventory management solution.

**Purpose:**

The primary purpose of `golang-toko` is to provide a straightforward, terminal-based application for managing basic store operations. It eliminates the need for complex and expensive software solutions, offering an accessible tool for those with limited resources or technical expertise.

**Goals:**

*   Provide a user-friendly command-line interface.
*   Enable efficient product and inventory management.
*   Offer basic transaction recording capabilities.
*   Be easily installable and configurable.
*   Remain lightweight and performant.

**Target Audience:**

Small business owners, market vendors, hobbyists, and individuals who need a simple inventory management tool without the overhead of a full-fledged point-of-sale system.

## Core Features:

*   **Product Management:** Add, update, and delete product information, including name, price, and description.
*   **Inventory Tracking:** Monitor stock levels, receive low-stock alerts, and update inventory quantities.
*   **Transaction Recording:** Record sales transactions, including items sold, quantities, and total amounts.
*   **Reporting:** Generate basic reports on sales, inventory levels, and product performance.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive command-line interface makes the application easy to use, even for those with limited technical experience.

## Installation/Setup

These instructions will guide you through installing and setting up `golang-toko` on your local machine.

**Prerequisites:**

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** `toko` command not found after installation.

**Solution:** Ensure the directory containing the `toko` executable is in your system's PATH environment variable. If you moved the executable to `/usr/local/bin` (or a similar directory), verify that `/usr/local/bin` is in your PATH. You may need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

**Problem:** Application crashes with a "file not found" error.

**Solution:** Verify that the data file (`data.json` by default) exists in the correct location. If you've changed the data file location, ensure the application is configured to use the new location.

**Problem:** Unable to install dependencies.
